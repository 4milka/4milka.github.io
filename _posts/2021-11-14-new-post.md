The memory impairing side effects of anti-anxiety medications, otherwise known as Benzodiazepines, have long been studied within the research literature. This is especially true 
when considering the long-term use of these drugs. In an effort to test the effects of these types of medication further, an experiment was conducted on two different drugs in 
comparison with a sugar pill as a placebo. 

As an added feature, the experiment included the priming of either happy or sad memories before carrying out the rest of the experiment. There has been research showing the effects 
of both happy and sad memories in memory recall, with sad memories tending to produce more accurate accounts of information and happy memories tending to lead more to false 
memories afterwards. This has been partly explained by historical evolutionary needs. The priming was done 10 minutes prior to testing, and participants were tested every day 
for one week to recreate addiction
